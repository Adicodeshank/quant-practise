/*ðŸ”¸ Memory Order Options
Order	                          Description
memory_order_relaxed	Atomicity only, no ordering guarantees
memory_order_acquire	Reads after can't be reordered before
memory_order_release	Writes before can't be reordered after
memory_order_acq_rel	Combines acquire + release
memory_order_seq_cst	Global sequential consistency (default, most strict)
